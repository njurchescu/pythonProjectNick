# Functions start with def
# best to name functions with two words,use _
def say_hi(name, age):  # we request a parameter
    # print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + age)
    print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + str(age))  # we give it a integer but we convert it to str


# print("Top")
# say_hi("Mike", "15")  # we need to call the function(we use a parameter)
say_hi("Mike", 15)
# say_hi("Steve", "46")
# print("Bottom")
